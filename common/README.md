#Common 

In the common directory, assemble code that will eventually be shared by the crawler, indexer, and querier. For now, that comprises code for initializing the "pageDirectory" and saving webpages there. (You will find reason to expand this file, and this directory, when you write the other subsystems.)

Create files pagedir.c and pagedir.h.
Write a Makefile that will, by default, build the common.a library. It must also have a clean target that removes files produced by Make.
Write a README.md file to describe any assumptions you made while writing the crawler, any ways in which your implementation differs from the three Specs, or any ways in which you know your implementation fails to work. This file may be short.
Write a .gitignore file telling Git to ignore any unnecessary files in this directory (anything not already covered by the top-level .gitignore).


implementation
- I have implemented pagedir_init and pagedir_save  in it.
- This also has a make file.
