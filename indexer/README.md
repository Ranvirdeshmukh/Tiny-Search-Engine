while implementing this program, I have used the output file from my crawler directory. copied it in this directory and ran it. The program runs extremely well and there are literally no memoryleaks and errors in the program. The program runs as expected.

Memory leaks:
==2397242== HEAP SUMMARY:
==2397242==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==2397242==   total heap usage: 334 allocs, 334 frees, 22,228 bytes allocated
==2397242== 
==2397242== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==2397242== 


There are extra files : readonly.index, test.index, output because they all are neccesary for the tests i have conducted.

Thank you so much.
Best,
